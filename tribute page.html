		The life of a samurai
	</h2>
	<p>In his book - Dokkodo: The Book Of Five Rings, he tells of having his first duel at the age og 13. When he was 16 he defeated a skillful warrior by the name of Tadashima Akiyama.
</p>
<h2>Duels</h2>

<p>In 1599, Musashi left his village, apparently at the age of 15. He left all his possesions with hei sister and her family. He then spent his time traveling and engaging in many duels.</p>
<p>In 1611 a duel was proposed between Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, a guest of the Hosokawa clan at the time. Some believe the duel was politically motivated at the time. </p>
<p>The duel was set for April 13, 1612, when Musashi was around 30 years old. The duel started with the two circiling each other, and Kojirō leaped toward Musashi with his trademark overhead strike. Musashi, too, jumped and swung his weapon with a shout, and the two sword strokes met. Musashi's headband fell off, sliced by Kojirō's sword, but somehow, only the headband was cut rather than Musashi's skull. Musashi's strike, meanwhile, had struck true, cleaving Kojirō's skull. </p>

<h2>Later life</h2>
<p>In 1643 he retired to a cave named Reigandō as a hermit to write The Book of Five Rings. He finished it in the second month of 1645. On the twelfth of the fifth month, sensing his impending death, Musashi bequeathed his worldly possessions, after giving his manuscript copy of The Book of Five Rings to the younger brother of Terao Magonojo, his closest disciple. He died in Reigandō cave around June 13, 1645</p>
